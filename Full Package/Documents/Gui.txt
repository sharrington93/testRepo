What:
        Goal is to make a gui that helps automate the input into the
simulation exe.

1) Decide on how gui will be made and programmed. This should include
research and reason for choosing this way of doing it. The Graphing project
should be considered.

2) Demo. Create a gui. That takes in an option file location and output
directory location and runs the exe
        bonus 1: display errors in the gui
        bonus 2: Use a file chooser to do these input operations
        This Demo needs to be deployable

3) Design complete layout and workflow of the gui
        drawings and operations for complete project laid out
        Talk with people on the team to come up with best layout and workflow

4) Design road map for development.
        Break into workable tasks that can be given to others
