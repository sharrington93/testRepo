Your project proposal definition:

What:
    program following functions to make the simulation a tool others can use. Numbered in priority (high(1) to low(inf)) you are not to move onto an other function until previous is completed and tested.
   
    1) FileToParams(file)
        goal: a function that can be used to load parameters into the simulation from a file
        input:     file as String: path to parameter txt file
        output: Dictionary of numpy arrays (look at resources below for help on this) where the key is the string of the header name for subsequent numpy array in the param file.

    2) OutputFile(file, Dict)
        goal: output all necessary information into a txt file
        input:     file as string: path to new file
                     Dict as Dictionary: Dictionary of numpy arrays with key as header for subsequent numpy array to be made in the txt file
        output: file is created and contains Dict data

    3)Support in migration to main model which includes example unpacking,packing code, and parameter file format using the actual parameters into the model. This parameter list will be in an email about sensitivity analysis.

Attached Example.txt is an example of the input and output file created/loaded.
first row is the headers, which are the keys in the dictionary
second row and on are the data.
the dictionary that would create this file or come from this file is as follows using dictionary format:
{'A' : [1,9], 'B' : [2], 'C' : [3,10]}

Attached is the Lookup.py that I used the numpy.loadtxt() function in.
 
How to submit:

Both functions are to be submitted as python scripts that test the function in question with any files required to do testing.

Due date:
by the 13th but by the 8th would much be better, there are more things to do!
