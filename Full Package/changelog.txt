CHANGELOG 0.35

	- Changed folder system to have a Deployment Package and a Full Package. Deployment
	  is for team members who want to use the Simulation while the Full Package is for
	  programmers

	- Removed Polina's feature request

	- Temporary fix to prevent the simulation from running after it's been closed

	- Changed the log name to accurately reflect new simulation name (SIMBA)

CHANGELOG 0.34

	- Added Julia's macro that manages post simulation data organization/representation

	- Changes requirements for OPTIONS.csv

	- Added a feature request from Polina.

CHANGELOG 0.33

	- Added input parameter (top_power)

	- Various bug fixes in automation and simulation

	- If certain input parameters are higher than values available in look up tables,
	  the simulation will warn the user about the issue and then change those parameters
	  to the highest value in the lookup table


CHANGELOG 0.32

	- Changes made to OPTIONS.csv to take input in from the third column. The column 
	  header should be "Output Folder" with the full path below it in the next row.

	- If the OPTIONS.csv the user inputs already has a output directory specified in it,
	  it is automatically copied into the output folder field. Otherwise, the simulation
	  will copy the value in the GUI field into OPTIONS.csv after running the simulation



CHANGELOG 0.31

	- New input parameters added

	- New output data from each simulation performed

	- Fixes to unit labels

	- Removed ability to select graphing program in preparation for next update

	- Added "Tools" to menubar (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED)


CHANGELOG 0.30

	- GUI introduced

	- Optional input for graphing program. Entering a graphing program will
	  automatically opened the files with that program when simulation is finished

	- Average Power calculation fixed

	- Dialog boxes appear when certain errors are found during execution

	- Quick values popup box added to quickly see certain results from the
	  simulation

	- Removed console

	- Updated Simulation Guide to reflect the new GUI and changes


CHANGELOG 0.21
	
	- Corrected how force is calculated

	- Fixed unit labels on output parameters

	- Added log that records script progress and any errors that occur. Log is saved
	  to directory that BCS.exe was ran from.


CHANGELOG 0.2

	- Asks user for input file and output folder before running simulation

	- Changed output parameters and values

	- Fixes to simulation.py for more accurate results

	- Fixes to Lookup Files

	- Sorts output files so that parameters with multiple values come first,
	  followed by parameters with only 1 value

	- Fixed an issue where if user entered a folder into the input options file
	  field, the program would crash
	
	- Fixed an issue where user could enter any output folder even if it's not
	  a possible or a writable folder
