What:
    Goal: make the use of the simulation more automated by allowing more than one input file to be used at a time. Look into ways to automate more.

    1) create a script as follows:
            a script that at takes in a formatted simulation file that (for now) holds all the input files and output files that are to be run through the simulation and run them. Formatted in the same way as the param file except now you can't assume all values are floats.
            You may assume that the simulation is a function called Simulation(in,out) where parameters "in" is the string path to the input file and "out" is a string path to where the output file should go and be named.
            I foresee this script being updated a lot to make automation better. The overarching goal is to separate the automation from the simulation as much as possible so a one developer can focus on programming the simulation while the another works on automation.

    2) Do research into the best way to automate the simulation tool that is being generated now. Automate param, simulation, output file creation and analysis. Tools do not need to be python!
        I want to see some a document describing how you think it should be automated. Talk about the pre-made tools we can use and tools we will have to make. Obviously this leads to the next project which is creating these automation tools.

 Resources:
    Same as before, this time you have to make the list in your research!

How to Submit:
   Task 1 requires the script and some test files (make a dead simple simulation function).
   Task 2 requires the document and maybe some small programs as a proof of concept.
    Lastly, a document containing resources and things learned.

Due date:
    I trust your judgment! Project given before has much higher precedence.
